Gwtck allows you to use CKEditor in GWT applications.

Started as a fork of gwt-ckeditor (http://code.google.com/p/gwt-ckeditor/)
as it did not allow to use plugins written in GWT to be attached to CKEditor.

Gwtck solves this problem. It uses gradle as its build system.

- `gradlew build` builds JAR attachable to your GWT project
- `gradlew devmode` allows you to watch wrapped CKEditor in action (feel free
  to modify EntryPoint and see what happens)
